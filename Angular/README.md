Angular is a JavaScript Framework which allows us to create reactive Single-Page-Applicaitons.
### Creating a new project:
```shell
$ng new my-first-app
```
Running this command will create a new project. It will ask a few questions around bindings, routing and styling. Choose as per your preference, and voila- your project is ready.  
  
After the project is build, go to that directory and run the command `ng serve` to start the application.
```shell
$cd my-first-app
$ng server
```
This will start the application on port 4200 by default.
