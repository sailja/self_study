## Rules for naming an identifier:
<a name='rules_for_naming_an_identifier'></a>
All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet, an underscore ( _ ), or a dollar sign ($).  
Can't begin with a digit.  The rest of the characters may be any of those previously mentioned plus the digits 0-9.  
Can't use a keyword as an identifier.

The convention is to always use a (lower case) letter of the alphabet. 
The dollar sign and the underscore are discouraged.
